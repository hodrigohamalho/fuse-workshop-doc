Welcome to the Fuse workshop! It's a pleasure to guide you on this hands-on experience. 

This workshop has as target to offer you a pratical experience with Red Hat Fuse, it's not a complete training

covery many aspects of Red Hat Fuse in deep.

As the objective is not cover all details and cover many Fuse aspects during this workshop, 
we will be using a https://github.com/hodrigohamalho/fuse-workshop.git[project skeleton] during this lab.

== Setup Code Ready Workspace

These walkthrough use Code Ready Workspace (Eclipse Che). 
It's an IDE on the cloud, but I recommend you to set up a local environment because it's usually what the most developers use on a daily routine. 

. It's not mandatory  you can use your preferred IDE, like Visual Studio Code, JBoss Developer Studio or IntelliJ.

To build the project in your own environment, you will need:

* JDK 7+
* Maven 3+
* Git 

If you already have all installed, just clone the git repository and run mvn install

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/hodrigohamalho/fuse-workshop.git
cd fuse-workshop
mvn spring-boot:run
----

The *fuse-workshop* project is a Camel Spring Boot project, 
with some code already did for you, it will provide help to make you 
focused in the what really matters instead of boilerplate code.

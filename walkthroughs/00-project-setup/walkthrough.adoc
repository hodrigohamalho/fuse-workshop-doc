= Lab 0 - Workshop Introduction

Workshop structure and environment set up.

Welcome to the Fuse workshop! It's a pleasure to guide you on this hands-on experience.

This workshop aims to offer you practical experience with Red Hat Fuse. It is not meant to be a complete training of Red Hat Fuse. For this purpose we have an amazing https://www.redhat.com/pt-br/services/training/jb421-red-hat-jboss-fuse-camel-development[official training], covering many aspects of Red Hat Fuse in depth.

The main objective is to cover as many Fuse aspects during this workshop. We will be using a https://github.com/hodrigohamalho/fuse-workshop.git[project skeleton] during this lab.

This *fuse-workshop* project is a Red Hat Fuse (aka https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel]) Spring Boot project, with some code already written for you. It will help you focus on what really matters rather than having you write lots of boilerplate code.

== Setup Code Ready Workspace

These walkthroughs use link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[CodeReady Workspaces, window="_blank"] (based on https://www.eclipse.org/che[Eclipse Che]).
It's an IDE on the cloud based on containers. You can also use a local development environment if you'd prefer (i.e. https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code], https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview[Red Hat CodeReady Studio] (formerly known as JBoss Developer Studio), https://www.jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ IDEA], etc).

Credentials:

* Username: `{user-username}`
* Password: `{user-password}`

{empty} +

It may take a few minutes for everything to start up. If everything worked fine, you should now see an IDE with your project imported.

{empty} +

When the setup is ready you should see a screen like this:

image::images/2-workspace-created.png[Importing project, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

{empty} +

Now, that you succesfully created the workspace take a while exploring the project structure using the `left menu`. 

image::images/3-che-side-menu.png[Side Menu - Project Structure, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

{empty} +

Run the project

. On the left menu, click on the cube icon and under the tools menu structure click on `Run application locally`
. You should see the application build and then run

image::images/4-che-run-locally.png[Running Application, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

{empty} +

As this project is a web app (we are going to explore it in future labs) codeready workspaces will suggest to you to open a link, click on `Open Link`. 

image::images/5-open-web-app.png[Running Application, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

{empty} +

In the end you should see a web app on the side menu, and a `hello router ` message in the logs.

To stop the application use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

Are you seeing a loop hello message in the logs?

== Running the labs in your local environment

If you are looking to build the project in your own environment (local machine), you will need:

* JDK 7+
* Git
* Maven 3+

{empty} +

Replace your `~/.m2/settings.xml` by the `fuse-workshop/configuration/settings.xml`

If you already have all installed, just clone the git repository and run `mvn install`

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/hodrigohamalho/fuse-workshop.git
cd fuse-workshop
mvn spring-boot:run

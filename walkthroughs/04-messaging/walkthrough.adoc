= Lab 4 - Messaging

Asynchronous messaging helps to de-couple applications. Messaging makes the messaging system responsible for transferring data from one application to another, so the apps can focus on what data they need to share but not worry so much about how to share it.

Let's create a RESTful endpoint that returns a quick response to the user, but do all the processing in the background. We are going to use the http://camel.apache.org/wiretap.html[wiretap] component to make a copy of the message in the Camel pipeline and post it in a JMS queue. After we recover from the queue and insert the order into the database, then notify the user by email.

== Async router

As we just done in the database session, let's start uncomenting the `messaging` session in the `pom.xml`.

First set a simple text message to return in the body.

[source,java]
----
.post("/async").type(Order.class).description("Create a new order")
    .route().routeId("create-order-async")
    .log("Async Order received")
    .setBody().simple("We received your request. As soon we process your request we will notify you by email.")
    .endRest();
----

Run the application and test, calling the POST async method accessing the Swagger UI page. Use the following body:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "item": "Red Hat Integration",
  "amount": 10,
  "description": "Middleware Integration Portfolio",
  "processed": true
}
----

Now, let's wiretap the body to work with the body async in the background.

[source,java]
----
    .post("/async").type(Order.class).description("Create a new order")
        .route().routeId("create-order-async")
        .log("Order received")
        .wireTap("direct:create-order")
        .setBody().simple("We received your request. As soon we process your request we will notify you by email.")
        .endRest();

    from("direct:create-order")
        .log("processing order async");
----

Run again and check the log to see if the new message *" processing order async "* appeared.

Now, instead of calling the SQL directly, let's send the order to a message broker.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:create-order")
    .log("sending ${body.item} to JMS queue")
    .to("activemq:queue:orders");
----

Your code should looks like this:

Run the application and test, calling the POST async method accessing the Swagger UI page.

Check the logs to see the messages exchanged in the queue. As we are using an embedded broker to test our application without the need to deploy in any place, there isn't a web console, so don't worry with it for now. When we deploy it on OpenShift, we'll take a look in the AMQ console.

[type=verification]
Do you see the message  *"processing order async"* in the logs when you create a new Order?

Everything should be working fine. To simulate the entire flow, let's create another route to consume from the queue and persist this information in the database. This second route could be another system consuming this message. Remember that this kind of architecture aims to decouple applications from one another. It could even perform retries in case of failures, scale independently of the consumer/producer, etc.

[source,java]
----
// Consume from the message broker queue
from("activemq:queue:orders")
    .log("received ${body.item} from JMS queue")
    .to(this.insertOrder)
    .to("mock:notify-by-email");
----

Re-run the integration and look at the logs.

On the next session we are going to deploy the integration into Openshift and we will be able to see all the messages passing through the AMQ via the AMQ Management Console.

== Summary

Congratulations you finished the Messaging lab.

We covered a lot of things during this lab. Here's a quick recap:

* How to interact with AMQ Broker (Artemis) using the **Artemis** Component
* How to run an **embedded Broker** in a local environment
* Working **asynchronously** with the **wireTap** Enterprise Integration Pattern
* Producing and Consuming messages

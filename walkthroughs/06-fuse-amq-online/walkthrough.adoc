This walkthrough demonstrates a fault tolerant integration pattern that integrates a message driven architecture with a RESTful API architecture.

Message-oriented middleware (MOM)::
MOM allows you to implement an asynchronous, routable, and transformable message queue.

API-centric architecture::
Typically, a developer working on a back-end application implements a synchronous RESTful API to allow communication from other applications.

You may identify business value, as part of an application modernization effort, by integrating a message queue with an API.
This is not trivial, because of the conflicting underlying timing models. The data may require transformation to be usable.

In this walkthrough, create a simple and intuitive integration with built-in monitoring, to enable communication between two applications:

* A Node.js webapp provides a method to create messages, in this example, a new inventory item.
* A Spring Boot CRUD app provides a RESTful API, in this example, an inventory API.

To create this integration, use link:{enmasse-url}[AMQ Online, window="_blank", id="wt1a_GS_enmasse-url"] and API connectors in link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank", id="wt1a_GS_fuse-url"].

All of the applications and services used in this walkthrough are running on Red Hat OpenShift.

=== Creating an API Connector

Fuse Online is an enterprise integration platform that provides connectors for many services, such as Gmail and IRC.
It can be extended with custom connectors, using either OpenAPI definitions (Swagger) or JAR files.
To create a connector for the RESTful API, register the OpenAPI definition as a *Customization*.

. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank", id="{context}-1"] console.

. Select *Customizations* from the left hand menu.

. Select the *Create API Connector* button to start the *API Client Connector* wizard.

. When prompted to *Upload OpenAPI Document*, select *Use a URL*:
.. Enter the following in the URL field:
